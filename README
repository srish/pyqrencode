An Introduction to PyQrencode

I am assuming that you are aware of what QRcodes are. If not then I further assume that you at least have sen QRcodes but do not know that they are called so. In any case, this simple GUI tool provides you with an option to create a QRcode for yourself based upon the string you input and the pixel and margin size you specify. The generated code can later be scanned using most of the handhelds available these days such as mobile phones. The file generated by this tool is a PNG file which gets saved in '/tmp'. You may save the image in the GUI by just right clicking it. Have fun playing with QRcodes :-)

REQUIREMENTS

Before using Pyten, you may need to have the following stuff in your system :
1. qrencode
2. Python
3. Glade
4. PyGTK2.x
5. Wekbit module

USING PyQrencode

Make sure you have the package qrencode installed. If not, then

# yum install qrencode

The GUI is pretty clean and easy to use. Just provide the string to be encoded, the pixel size and the margin. The pixel size and margin is restricted to 10 and 3 respectively. On clicking 'Generate', the PNG is generated and displayed. You may choose o save it by right-clicking.

TODO

* Make the GUI better (proper spacers)
* Experiment with PyQt
